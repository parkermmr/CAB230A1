### Summary

This is a project encompassing the simple `Gradescope` questions for assignment one for CAB203 - Web Computing.

To run the testing use the `npm` command:

```bash
npm test
```

***Note:*** The test client used by grade scope DOES NOT use ES6 modules. For the purposes of testing and JavaScript common practices this repository uses ES6 modules which will parse as invalid syntax by the Gradescope test client. To prevent this, commenting out the `export { ... }` at the bottom of the file will cause the test client to pass.
